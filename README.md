The aim of this project is to create tools that:

1) Analyze sentiment and public reactions to Asian pop culture.
2) Identify the elements that capture attention in American media, particularly in fashion and music trends.
   
To achieve these goals, we will create a public GitHub repository to share the code and data analysis tools used in this project. This will make the tools accessible to others who want to analyze cultural trends and media narratives. By focusing on data-driven insights, the repository will provide a concrete way to examine and understand how Asian identity is represented and received in Western media and culture.
